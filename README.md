# PySpaceInvaders
PySpaceInvaders: A Python arcade game inspired by Space Invaders. Defend Earth from alien invaders with simple controls, concepts  and retro graphics.

In this Python-based game, you take control of a powerful spacecraft equipped with laser cannons, tasked with defending Earth and its neighboring planets from waves of incoming alien invaders. Inspired by classic arcade games like Space Invaders, PySpaceInvaders combines retro-style gameplay with modern graphics and intuitive controls.

Simple Concepts:

While PySpaceInvaders offers thrilling gameplay and immersive features, its development was grounded in simple programming concepts, making it accessible to both novice and experienced Python developers. The game leverages basic concepts such as:

Object-Oriented Programming: PySpaceInvaders is built using object-oriented programming principles, with classes and objects representing game entities such as the player's spacecraft, alien invaders, bullets, and power-ups.

Event Handling: The game utilizes event handling mechanisms to detect user input, such as keyboard commands for moving the spacecraft and firing lasers, ensuring responsive and interactive gameplay.

Collision Detection: Simple collision detection algorithms are employed to detect collisions between game entities, allowing for accurate gameplay mechanics such as destroying alien invaders upon contact with the player's lasers.

Game Loop: A fundamental game loop structure governs the execution of the game, handling tasks such as updating the game state, rendering graphics, and responding to user input in a continuous loop, maintaining smooth and uninterrupted gameplay.
